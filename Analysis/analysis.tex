\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Client Identification}
The client approached me and asked for a system for demonstrating phyiscal interactions between 2d objects, with the specific purpose of to help teach the new specification of physics AS. The deployment of this system will be in a sixth form college with approximately 60 students studying physics at AS level, often during class time, fixed simulations are used to demonstrate key points, however, these are limited.
\subsection{Define the current system}
The current system uses 'fixed' simulations downloaded from the internet, these are customisable, to a limited degree as in you can change the values during the simulation, however you cannot create customised environments.
\subsection{Describe the problems}
The main problem is that the current software is not adaptable to the specific requirements of the college, or the students. This means that the students are limited to a set list of possibilities with which they can experiment.
