\chapter{Analysis}

\section{Introduction}
	My client is a local church based in central Cambridge, they currently have a pen, paper and verbal system for organising many of the staff, assets and events within the church. There is also no official way to report incidents both pastoral and material.

\subsection{Client Identification}
	My client is a mid-sized city centre church with 250 regular attendees and around 60 people who are involved in rotas and with responsibilities. There are several components to the Church's operation broadly split into two sections: People and resources. People represents all of the meetings, appointments and responsibilities, it also includes records of these meetings and appointments; and resources represents the materials that are required for the smooth operation of the Church, for example Teabags and Support Tickets. The Church also needs to regularly send out emails to inform it's members of their responsibilities and to keep them up to date with church news.

\subsection{Define the current system}
	The current system is a mixture of word of mouth and emails containing scraps of information, people are expected to keep appointments and duties in whatever diary system they have and they do this with a reasonable degree of success. For the cafe stock management, whoever is operating the till keeps a handwritten record of whatever has been sold, which is then added to a central ledger at the end of the day. For all of the incident reporting (support tickets, prayer requests etc) emails are used as the primary way of official communication, often the same set of people are copied into whatever email conversations that take place.
