\chapter{Analysis}

\section{Introduction}
	My client is a local church based in central Cambridge, they currently have a pen, paper and verbal system for organising many of the staff, assets and events within the church. There is also no official way to report incidents both pastoral and material.

\subsection{Client Identification}
	My client is a mid-sized city centre church with 250 regular attendees and around 60 people who are involved in rotas and with responsibilities. There are several components to the Church's operation broadly split into two sections: People and resources. People represents all of the meetings, appointments and responsibilities, it also includes records of these meetings and appointments; and resources represents the materials that are required for the smooth operation of the Church, for example Teabags and Support Tickets. The Church also uses mailing lists and stuff
